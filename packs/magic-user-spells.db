This spell causes instant growth (and corresponding increase in weight and damage done) of a single object or creature that is in visible range. This increase changes a creature&rsquo;s size by 20% per caster level, up to three times the original size of the creature. The effectiveness of this spell is half of this on non-living objects, which are only enlarged 10% per level and to a maximum of double the original size of the object. The caster can affect a 10' cube of living matter per level or a 5' cube per level of non-living matter. Magical item properties are not affected by this spell. For instance, a wand will have the same function even though it is increased to the size of a staff, and potion dosages are not increased, though they may take longer to drink. Objects do become stronger or heavier, so that a small rock gains the weight of an appropriately sized larger one, and a person enlarged will have a strength appropriate to his size (as an ogre or a giant, for example) with corresponding strength adjustments. The damage done by an Enlarged character during m&ecirc;l&eacute;e is increased by the same percentage as his size. The reverse of Enlarge, Reduce, can reduce objects or creatures in size by the same proportions as Enlarge. These spells cancel each other out.
